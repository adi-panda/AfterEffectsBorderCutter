# AfterEffectsBorderCutter

Tool for creating borders in after effects.

Duplicates the layer underneath, turns on the fill, turns off the stroke, and changes blending mode to stencil alpha.

When Animating borders with effects, allows for only the inside of the border to be shown.

1. Draw a border with fill opacity turned to 0%, and apply any effects or animations. 
2. Use the plugin and only the inside will be shown.
